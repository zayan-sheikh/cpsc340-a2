"""
Implementation of function objects.
Function objects encapsulate the behaviour of an objective function that we optimize.
Simply put, implement evaluate(w, X, y) to get the numerical values corresponding to:
f, the function value (scalar) and
g, the gradient (vector).

Function objects are used with optimizers to navigate the parameter space and
to find the optimal parameters (vector). See optimizers.py.
